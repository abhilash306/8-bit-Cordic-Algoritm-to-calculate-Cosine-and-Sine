# 8-bit-Cordic-Algoritm-to-calculate-Cosine-and-Sine

â€¢	Design of an 8-bit Cordic-based Sine and Cosine Processor using Verilog: (Prof. Kaushik Saha)	(August, 2023)
-The entire RTL to GDS flow was performed using Cadence Genus and Innovus tools in UMC65 technology.
-Created SDC for precise timing, performed Floor Planning, CTS, Routing, and cleared DRC for manufacturability.
-Analyzed pre-CTS and post-CTS timing, ensuring optimal setup and hold slack.
